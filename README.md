# Survival-Shooter-AI
Small Project programming an AI to play a survival Shooter Game

-the Algorithm:
The AI has a look range around him and he can see all the objects inside of it then he uses the values to construct a grid of values around him. After that, he chooses the perfect point with the more efficient value and moves toward it.

for calculating the values 
-we add the distance from the point to a cover
-we substruct the distance from the monsters

the project was done using C# and Unity3D

the Asset is from Unity survival shooter project:
